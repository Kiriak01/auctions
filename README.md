# Auctions-Website
This is a web application I've built as an assignment for my University course "Web Programming". This website enables users to create and bid on auctions. The tech stack I used was JavaScript(React), Python(Django, as well as Django REST Framework) and MySQL. 

The whole feature-list of the website is the following: 
* Multiple user roles (admin,guest,seller,bidder) with proper authorization levels. 
* JSON Web Tokens for authorizations using the simple-jwt package.
* OpenStreetMap for every auction, so the users can display real time location information.
* Gradient descent algorithm to suggest new auctions to users based on their bidding and visit history.
